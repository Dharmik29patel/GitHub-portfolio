🎯 Goal: Build a dashboard visualizing pollutant trends by company, region, or chemical over the last decade.

🔍 Data Source: EPA Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)

📦 Skills Used: SQL, Tableau/Power BI, ETL (Python), Data Cleaning

🧠 Plan:
Download TRI data from EPA (10-year trend for NH + neighboring states)

Process & filter to include total air/water/land discharges

Clean and normalize (e.g., units, FIPS mapping)

Load to SQL/PostgreSQL or connect directly to Tableau

Create visualizations:

Pollution by region

Top polluting facilities or chemicals

Year-over-year change

Add filters (industry, chemical, year) and interactivity
