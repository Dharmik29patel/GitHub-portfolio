🎯 Goal: Build a predictive model to forecast electricity usage across residential, commercial, and government sectors.

🔍 Data Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) or ISO New England

📦 Skills Used: Python, Pandas, Time Series Modeling (ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost), Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn

🧠 Plan:
Collect monthly energy consumption data (2010–2024) by state/sector

Clean and structure the time series

Visualize trends and seasonal patterns

Split into training/test, create baseline models (mean, naive), and then try:

ARIMA / SARIMA

Facebook Prophet

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

Evaluate with RMSE/MAE on test set

Deploy interactive charts (optional): Streamlit or Tableau

Blog-style README explaining forecasting assumptions and findings

✅ Outcome:
Showcases: data wrangling, time series expertise, modeling and insights

Bonus: Relevant to utility companies, government roles, and energy startups
